# This is an optional routine, which lets you define a final subroutine to act upon 
# the scanned documents. In this example, we are:
# 1. converting them from png to highly compressed JPEG (smaller for email)
# 2. merging them into one final pdf
# 3. deleting everything apart from the pdf in that folder
#
# Variables available:
#	$FINALDST (final destination, this is where your scanned documents end up)
#	$TEMPDIR (where our temporary files are prior to being merged to PDF
#	and/or copied to $FINALDST).
#	$NAME (the prefix defined as your argument)
sub callback_last {
